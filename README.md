## About The Project

![Screen Shot](./public/images/Screenshot%202024-09-14%20080339.png)

Empower students, streamline institutional processes, foster collaboration, and bridge the gap between academia and industry, with a focus on addressing specific challenges faced in India.

Problem:-

1. Challenge: Current academic project management systems lack integration with real-world opportunities and often fail to provide effective platforms for showcasing and collaborating on projects.
2. Impact: Students face difficulty in presenting their work to potential employers, institutions struggle with managing and tracking projects, and industry partners find it challenging to identify and connect with emerging talent.
3. Context: This problem is particularly pronounced in India, where there is a need for platforms that align with local educational and industrial needs while addressing global standards.

Solution:-

* Sandbox is an all-in-one platform designed to transform academic project management by providing a comprehensive solution for showcasing, managing, and connecting projects.
